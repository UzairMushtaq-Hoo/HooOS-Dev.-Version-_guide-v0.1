# Rooms

In the Room Collection, each room information is added under a floor at which that specific room is created. Furthermore, the room is stored in the database in a specific format, that is  `'Room_Owner'+'Room_Type'`.

Here is the structure of Rooms in the database:

* **Rooms**
  * Floor\_Name

    * Owner\_Name,Room\_Name: true

Here is an example of rooms data in FireStore:
